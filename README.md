# Pi-hole Web Interface

<img src="https://pi-hole.github.io/graphics/Screenshots/v6/v6_dashboard.png" alt="Pi-hole Web interface">

Pi-hole[®](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/)'s Web interface (based off of [AdminLTE](https://github.com/ColorlibHQ/AdminLTE)) provides a central location to manage your Pi-hole and review the statistics generated by FTLDNS[™](https://pi-hole.net/trademark-rules-and-brand-guidelines/).

- **Easy-to-interpret**: simple graphs and beautiful colors make Pi-hole's stats easy to understand
- **Responsive**: looks great on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices
- **Useful**: control and configure your Pi-hole with our settings
- **Insightful**: use the query log, including long-term stats to gain insight into your networks activity

# Installation

The Web interface is enabled by default when you install Pi-hole.

## Post-installation: access the Web interface and gain insight into your network's activity

There are several ways to access the dashboard:

1. `https://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_PI_HOLE>/admin/`
2. `https://pi.hole/admin/` (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)
3. `https://pi.hole/` (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)

> [!TIP]
> You can access the web interface using `http://` or `https://` protocols.

Once logged in, you can view your network stats to see things like:

- the domains being queried on your network
- the time the queries were initiated
- the amount of domains that were blocked
- the upstream server queries were sent to
- the type of queries (`A`, `AAAA`, `CNAME`, `SRV`, `TXT`, etc.)
